I have little to no idea what I ma doing. I'm trying to make java 1.9.4 minecraft in browser, but alas it is out of my league currently.

Currently I am trying to import minecraft's files over to github but organizing is taking a while.
The next step is adding an account sign-in.
Thanks for reading.
